A tennis match is composed of points, games, and sets.
A set consists of a number of games (a minimum of six), which in turn each consist of points.
A set is won by the first side to win 6 games, with a margin of at least 2 games over the other side (e.g. 6–3 or 7–5).
If the set is tied at six games each, a tie-break is usually played to decide the set.
A match is won when a player or a doubles team has won the majority of the prescribed number of sets.
Matches employ either a best-of-three (first to two sets wins) or best-of-five (first to three sets wins) set format.

A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving, and is won by the first side to have won
at least four points with a margin of two points or more over their opponent.

A single-elimination, knockout, or sudden death tournament is a type of elimination tournament
where the loser of each match-up is immediately eliminated from the tournament.
Each winner will play another in the next round, until the final match-up,
whose winner becomes the tournament champion. Each match-up may be a single match or several,
for example two-legged ties in European sports or best-of series in American pro sports.
Defeated competitors may play no further part after losing,
or may participate in "consolation" or "classification" matches against other losers to determine
the lower final rankings; for example, a third place playoff between losing semi-finalists.
In a shootout poker tournament, there are more than two players competing at each table,
and sometimes more than one progressing to the next round.
